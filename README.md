# DailyChecklistAutomation
(WIP) I am in the process of automating a daily checklist, This is my first project with coding and first python development. (Feedback about style and optimization are fully welcomed) This is a small part of the scrpit, eventually it will check emails overnight and automatically make support tickets and update the excel document as the reports come in.
